# carbon14-boxmodel
A simple carbon-cycle box diffusion model for radiocarbon studies in R. The model simulates how radiocarbon (14C) produced in the upper atmosphere and decaying over time, is transported and cycled through the atmosphere, biosphere, and ocean. It was implemented for geochronological and ice core research surrounding cosmogenic radionuclides, where users seek to convert ice core 10Be data to atmospheric 14C production (p14C) for direct comparison to radiocarbon records (e.g. IntCal). The code was written following the design presented in: Siegenthaler, U., Heimann, M. & Oeschger, H. 14C variations caused by changes in the global carbon cycle. Radiocarbon 22, 177–191 (1980).

This version of the box diffusion model for 14C cycling is set up to run an equilibrium experiment, where the system evolves without external perturbations until it reaches a steady state. The code also includes commented-out lines that can be activated to apply changes in atmospheric ¹⁴C, i.e., allowing users to run perturbation experiments to study transient responses. This model was employed to produce the results presented in: Muschitiello, F., D’Andrea, W.J., Schmittner, A. et al. Deep-water circulation changes lead North Atlantic climate during deglaciation.
