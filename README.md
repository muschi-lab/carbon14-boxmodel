# carbon14-boxmodel
A simple box diffusion model for radiocarbon studies in R. The model simulates how radiocarbon (14C) produced in the atmosphere and decaying over time, is transported and cycled through the atmosphere, biosphere, and ocean.
The code was written following the design presented in: Siegenthaler, U. and Oeschger, H., 1987. Biospheric CO2 emissions during the past 200 years reconstructed by deconvolution of ice core data. Tellus B: Chemical and Physical Meteorology, 39(1-2), pp.140-154.

This version of the box diffusion model for 14C cycling is set up to run an equilibrium experiment, where the system evolves without external perturbations until it reaches a steady state. The code also includes commented-out lines that can be activated to apply changes in atmospheric ¹⁴C, i.e., allowing users to run perturbation experiments to study transient responses. This model was used to produce the results presented in: Muschitiello, F., D’Andrea, W.J., Schmittner, A. et al. Deep-water circulation changes lead North Atlantic climate during deglaciation.
